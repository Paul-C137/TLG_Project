# TLG_Project

The purpose of the repo is to store and manage version control for necessary files related to the
"Dashboard3000" project.  My aim is for Dashboard3000 to allow me to learn about APIs, Flask, sqlite,
and other interesting topics and apply what I have learned in a fun and useful way.  Why "Dashboard"?
Well, I plan to pull data that is relevant to me from various sources and display it in a useful, 
centralized fashion.  Why "3000"?  Because, everything that ends with 3000 is way cooler!
